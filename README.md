# APFT-Coach

As a Marketing developer, I want to provide appealing appearance of our APFT-Coach site to the user.

As a Marketing developer, I want to provide the proper instructions so that the developer has specific instructions on how the page should render.

As a developer, I want to tailor content specific to the end user and not add extra features not needed.

As a developer, I want to style the CSS in a way that the visiting user has clear understanding of functionality just by simply looking at the page.


APFT-Coach is an application for United States Army Service members and any person that wants to calculate potential test scores for passing the Army Physical Fitness Test. This is a practical tool for test administrators as well as individuals to use before, during and after the APFT. Administrators can use this web app to calculate and display results for several users at a time.
Results will include total scores for each physical event such as the Push-ups, Sit-up and 2 mile run events. Administrators will also have the ability to provide real time feedback on body fat composition for test takers.
